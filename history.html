				<h1>Monstera Deliciosa History</h1>
			</div>
			<div id="history-text">
				<p>Monsteras originate from tropical regions in Central America, ranging from the southernmost part of Mexico to Panama. Monstera is also found in other areas where it was introduced, like Hawaii. </p>
				<p>These plants thrive in dense rainforests where they use their aerial roots to "climb" up trees towards the light in the canopy. Young leaves will grow toward the darkest part of a tree base, which helps them find and attach to a sturdy trunk. </p>
				<p>No one knows exactly what monstera's iconic holes are for, though it's theorized that the holes develop so the leaves can withstand high winds without tearing, or to allow a little more light to pass through the upper leaves to the lower leaves. </p>
				<p>Monstera plants can grow up to 20 meters tall in the wild and the leaves can grow up to a meter long! Indoors, however, most monsteras top out at about ten feet, which is still considerable for a houseplant.</p>
				<p>Before monstera leaves mature, their heart-shaped leaves have no holes and look similar to those of pothos or philodendron (this might also be where some of the split-leaf philodendron confusion comes from) That's also one reason why it's hard to tell some monstera varieties apart when they're young because they haven't developed those characteristic holes yet. Many varieties get even more holes with age, so it's easier to tell the age of the plant.</p>
				<p>When <em>monstera deliciosa</em> is about 3 years old, it flowers and produces fruit, which is one of the reasons why this plant was first cultivated. </p>
