<h1>Monstera Deliciosa History</h1>
<h3><strong>Subtitle</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monsteras originate from tropical regions in Central America, ranging from the southernmost part of Mexico to Panama. Monstera is also found in other areas where it was introduced, like Hawaii. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These plants thrive in dense rainforests where they use their aerial roots to &ldquo;climb&rdquo; up trees towards the light in the canopy. Young leaves will grow toward the darkest part of a tree base, which helps them find and attach to a sturdy trunk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one knows exactly what monstera&rsquo;s iconic holes are for, though it&rsquo;s theorized that the holes develop so the leaves can withstand high winds without tearing, or to allow a little more light to pass through the upper leaves to the lower leaves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monstera plants can grow up to 20 meters tall in the wild and the leaves can grow up to a meter long! Indoors, however, most monsteras top out at about ten feet, which is still considerable for a houseplant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before monstera leaves mature, their heart-shaped leaves have no holes and look similar to those of pothos or philodendron (this might also be where some of the split-leaf philodendron confusion comes from) That&rsquo;s also one reason why it&rsquo;s hard to tell some monstera varieties apart when they&rsquo;re young because they haven&rsquo;t developed those characteristic holes yet. Many varieties get even more holes with age, so it&rsquo;s easier to tell the age of the plant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">monstera deliciosa</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is about 3 years old, it flowers and produces fruit, which is one of the reasons why this plant was first cultivated. </span></p>
